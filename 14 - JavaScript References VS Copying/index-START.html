    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    // let age = 100;
    // let age2 = age;
    // console.log(age, age2);
    // age = 200;
    // console.log(age, age2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;

    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = "Lux";

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // Answer: Updating an array will reference back on the array. 
    // So with the above, if we changed the 3rd index (poppy) to Lux, that then updates the players array to the change we made of "Lux" in that 3rd index

    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice();  // splice creates a new array based off of the original and does not reference back on the original

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players]    // Takes every item out of the iterable (array) and put it into the containing array
    team4[3] = 'hee hawww';
    console.log(team4);   // will show the original players array from above, but also does not change the original array.

    const team5 = Array.from(players)

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    // const captain = person;
    // captain.number = 99;

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    Object.assign( {}, person, { number: 99, age: 12 });
    console.log(cap2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person};

    // *** Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it. ***
    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes',
      age: 100;
      social; {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
        facebook: 'wesbos.dev'
      }
    }

    console.clear();
    console.log(wes);

    // Make a copy of const wes from above
    const dev = Object.assign( {}, wes);
    // So if you do dev.social.twitter = "@coolman"; then it updates to that in dev.social
    // BUT!! it also references back to the original (wes) const and updates/changes the value there too! 
    // This is due to the methods above only going 1 level deep

    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes)); 
    // This is a not really recommended way to do the changes to some levels deep. But it isn't really recommended.
